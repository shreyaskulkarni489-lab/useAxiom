# Developer 1 (Tech Lead & AI Architect) - Detailed Work Report

## 1. Executive Summary & Role Definition
As the Tech Lead and AI Architect, Developer 1 is responsible for the overall structural integrity of the `useAxiom` platform and the core intelligence engine. The primary mandate was to design a system capable of handling complex, long-running AI planning tasks while supporting rapid, parallel development by multiple engineers.

## 2. Deep Dive: What Has Been Implemented

### 2.1 Monorepo Architecture Setup
- **Tooling:** Initialized the repository utilizing `pnpm` workspaces combined with `Turborepo`.
- **Configuration Files:** 
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Explicitly maps the `apps/*` and `packages/*` directories.
  - `turbo.json`: Defines the build pipeline cache strategies, ensuring tasks like `build`, `lint`, and `dev` are parallelized and cached based on file hashing.
- **Strict Boundary Enforcement:** Established the rule that applications in `apps/` (like `backend-api` and `manager-dashboard`) may consume `packages/` (like `@useaxiom/database`), but `apps/` can *never* depend on other `apps/`. This prevents circular dependencies and monolithic entanglement.

### 2.2 AI Sub-system Scaffolding
- **`packages/ai-core`:** Created the foundational package for the orchestration engine. This module is designed to house the main Agent loop that will interpret manager inputs and decompose them into actionable project plans.
- **`packages/ai-providers`:** Scaffolded the abstraction layer for Large Language Models (LLMs). This ensures the platform isn't hard-coupled to a single provider (e.g., OpenAI), allowing dynamic switching or failovers to Anthropic or Gemini.
- **`packages/ai-tools`:** Prepared the directory where specific AI tools (like web search, database querying, or schema validation) will be registered for the agent to use.
- **`packages/ai-memory`:** Scaffolded the context management system required to persist conversation history and long-term project context across stateless API calls.

### 2.3 Governance & Documentation
- **`AGENTS.md`:** Authored the definitive ruleset for the project, assigning specific domains to developers (D1-D5) and establishing hard technical constraints (e.g., "No CRUD Violations", "Strict TypeScript").
- **`docs/08-team/onboarding.md`:** Created the onboarding manual to streamline the integration of new developers into the complex monorepo structure.

## 3. Architectural Decisions & Rationale (The "Why")

### Why a "Modular Monolith" over Microservices?
A full microservice architecture introduces significant DevOps overhead (network latency, distributed tracing, complex deployments). A modular monolith using Turborepo provides the organizational isolation of microservices (distinct packages) with the deployment simplicity of a monolith. 

### Why split the AI into multiple packages?
AI systems evolve rapidly. By decoupling `ai-providers` from `ai-core`, if the team needs to switch from OpenAI's `gpt-4` to a new open-source model, they only need to update the provider package without rewriting the core orchestration logic.

## 4. Exhaustive Tech Stack
- **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (Chosen for strict dependency resolution and symlinked speed).
- **Build System:** `Turborepo` (Chosen for incremental builds and intelligent caching).
- **Environment:** Node.js (v20+).
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode enabled, no implicit `any`).
- **Formatting & Linting:** ESLint, Prettier, Husky (pre-commit hooks).

## 6. Detailed Developer Flow (Turborepo in Action)
1. **Local Development:** A developer runs `pnpm turbo run dev` at the root.
2. **Task Graph Resolution:** Turborepo reads `turbo.json` and analyzes the dependency graph. It sees that `apps/backend-api` depends on `packages/database`.
3. **Parallel Execution:** It instantly spins up the Next.js frontend (`apps/manager-dashboard`) and the NestJS backend (`apps/backend-api`) on separate ports concurrently.
4. **Cache Hits:** If Developer 1 changes a file in `packages/ai-core`, Turborepo detects the hash change. On the next build, it *only* rebuilds `ai-core` and the `background-workers` app that consumes it, instantly loading the rest from the `.turbo/` cache.

## 7. Current State & Immediate Next Steps
The monorepo structure is 100% stable and successfully utilized by the entire team. Developer 1's immediate next step is to begin writing the actual runtime logic inside `packages/ai-core/src/orchestrator.ts` to process incoming project scopes.
